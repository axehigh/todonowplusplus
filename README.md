An idea I had many years ago was to wrap a todo mobile app 
around a text file so that I could add todo on the move 
as well when sitting on my desktop.

I created 2 versions for android, but eventually I lost interest in the project.

With Antigravity and Webstorm I picked it up again, and soon I had the same features as in my android app.
