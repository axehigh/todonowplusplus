**History**
An idea I had many years ago was to wrap a todo mobile app 
around a text file so that I could add todo on the move 
as well when sitting on my desktop.

I created 2 versions for android, but eventually I lost interest in the project. 

I picked it up again now, and with Antigravity and Webstorm I quickly had the same features as before.
